Getting Started
Prerequisites

This project requires the following:
 * Programming Language: Python (Version 3.x recommended)
  
 * Terminal: Any command-line interface (CMD, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.)
Installation

 * Clone the repository:
   git clone [https://github.com/Tethi04/Calculator-CLI-app/]

 * Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Calculator-CLI-App

 * Verify Python is installed:
   python --version

Usage
Run the project with the following command:
python calculator.py

Example Interaction:
--- CLI Calculator App ---
Select operation:
1. Add (+)
2. Subtract (-)
3. Multiply (*)
4. Divide (/)
Q. Quit

Enter choice (1/2/3/4 or Q): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

Testing
Since this is a lightweight script, testing is done manually by running the application and verifying outputs.
 * Run the app: python calculator.py
 * Test Edge Cases:
   * Try dividing by zero (should show an error message).
   * Try entering letters instead of numbers (should handle invalid input).
   * Test decimal numbers (e.g., 5.5 + 2.1).
